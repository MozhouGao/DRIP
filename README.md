# Downwind road intersection point (DRIP)

### Overview 
DRIPs are estimated by extending a virtual line downwind of a point source location until it intersects the nearest public road. This virtual line represents the best estimate available of a time-averaged plume centreline emanating from the point source under a constant wind direction. The virtual line can extend downwind by a pre-defined distance threshold.
