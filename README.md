# Downwind road intersection point (DRIP)

### Overview 
Downwind road intersection point (DRIP) estimates the locations that have maximum probability of intersecting plumes for point sources.

- DRIPs are estimated by extending a virtual line downwind of a well or facility point location until it intersects the nearest public road. This virtual line represents the best estimate available of a time-averaged plume centreline emanating from the well or facility point under a constant wind direction. The virtual line can extend downwind by a pre-defined distance threshold, but the effective distance for detection varies according to the emission rate, weather conditions, and vehicle system characteristics such as the measurement rate, resolution, and driving speed.
